The Do-files presented here were developed using Stata 17-64MP, in a 32GB RAM computer.

    ##################### Navegating in the Repository 
    The current repository consists mainly in three folders. The first one is regarding the Do-file. The do-file ("Do-file - Queen Bees or Agents of Change") install packages (ados included) and run the econometrics.
    The second folder is regarding the datasets.
    The third folder presents the logs of the results.

    ##################### Disclaimer About the Dataset 
    The dataset mainly consists in agregated data from the brazilian work labor census (RAIS - "Relação Anual de Informações Sociais"). This dataset used to be publicly available but was removed from public access due to the LGPD ("Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados"), the data protection law (similar to the GDPR). This is the reason that the researchers are not allowed to share the original versions (identified or identifiable) of those datasets.
    If you have access to the original dataset (tables with identified individuals, by year and company - "RAIS Vínculos"), we are glad to help replicating the construction of the consolidated databases.
    
If you have any doubts or struggle to replicate the results, don't hesitate to contact us.
